    <h1>Privacy Policy and Data Governance Framework</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated and Effective Date: January 7, 2026</p>

    <section class="intro">
        <p>At Fluent AI, we place significant importance on matters relating to privacy and the responsible handling of information in the context of our operations. This document, which is referred to throughout as the Privacy Policy or simply the Policy, outlines in considerable detail the various practices, procedures, and principles that govern our approach to data within the scope of the services we provide.</p>
        <p>The Policy applies to all interactions between you, the individual user of our platform (who may be referred to herein as the user, you, or the data subject), and Fluent AI (which may be referred to as the company, we, us, or our). It is intended to serve as a comprehensive reference point for understanding the full spectrum of activities related to information collection, storage, processing, utilization, and related matters.</p>
        <p>By choosing to access, register with, or otherwise make use of the conversational language tutoring platform and associated features (collectively described as the Service), you indicate your awareness of the contents of this Policy and your agreement to its terms. Continued engagement with the Service following any review of this document constitutes acceptance of the described practices.</p>
        <p>We may from time to time review and update this Policy to reflect changes in technology, operational requirements, regulatory environments, or service enhancements. Users are encouraged to periodically consult the most current version of this document. Continued use of the Service after any such modifications will be understood as acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
        <p>The following sections provide additional explanatory material regarding various aspects of our data-related activities. These sections are presented for informational purposes and to promote a thorough understanding of the relevant processes.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Scope of Information Collection Activities</h2>
    <section>
        <p>In connection with the delivery of an effective and adaptive language learning experience, we engage in the collection of various categories of information. This collection occurs through multiple channels and serves multiple legitimate purposes related to service functionality and improvement.</p>
        
        <h3>1.1 Information Provided Directly by Users</h3>
        <p>Certain information is obtained directly from users during registration, profile creation, or other voluntary interactions. This may include account identifiers, contact details, demographic information, language learning objectives, payment processing details (handled through third-party providers), feedback submissions, support communications, and contributions to community features.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Audio and Interaction Data</h3>
        <p>The Service incorporates audio-based exercises that involve recording and analyzing spoken input. Such processing encompasses various acoustic elements and is necessary for providing feedback, assessing progress, and supporting underlying speech recognition and synthesis capabilities.</p>
        
        <h3>1.3 Technical and Usage Metadata</h3>
        <p>Various technical details are automatically collected to support operational requirements. These may include device identifiers, network information, session data, interaction patterns, and similar diagnostic or performance-related metrics.</p>
        
        <h3>1.4 Derived and Analytical Information</h3>
        <p>Additional insights may be generated through analytical processes applied to collected data. These derived elements contribute to personalization and ongoing service refinement.</p>
        
        <p>The categories described above are illustrative rather than exhaustive, and collection practices may evolve in line with technological advancements and service developments.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>2. Utilization for Algorithmic Development and Model Enhancement</h2>
    <section>
        <p>The Service relies on sophisticated machine learning systems. Information collected from users contributes to the ongoing development and refinement of these systems through established training methodologies.</p>
        <p>By using the Service, users grant a broad license permitting the incorporation of their interaction data into training processes. Once integrated into trained models, such information becomes part of the underlying architecture and may be retained accordingly.</p>
        <p>These activities support continuous improvement of the platform and the broader advancement of language education technology.</p>
        <p>Additional details regarding technical implementation may be available in supporting documentation or upon specific inquiry.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>3. Commercial Activities and Third-Party Collaborations</h2>
    <section>
        <p>To support ongoing operations and development, we engage in various forms of data utilization and collaboration. These may involve sharing aggregated, anonymized, or pseudonymized information with partners in relevant sectors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sharing of non-identifying insights with educational, technological, or analytical partners for mutual benefit.</li>
            <li>Licensing of aggregated datasets for research or commercial purposes.</li>
            <li>Disclosure to affiliates, contractors, and service providers as required for operational support.</li>
            <li>Transfer of data assets in connection with corporate transactions or restructuring.</li>
            <li>Other disclosures as deemed appropriate for legal, security, or operational reasons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Such activities are considered integral to sustaining and expanding the availability of advanced language learning resources.</p>
        <p>Further elaboration on specific partnerships or initiatives may be provided in separate announcements or documentation.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>4. Data Retention Practices</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Information is retained for periods necessary to fulfill operational, analytical, legal, and developmental purposes. Retention duration may vary depending on data type and applicable requirements.</p>
        <p>Certain data incorporated into models or archived systems may be maintained indefinitely. Residual copies may persist following account closure due to technical and operational considerations.</p>
        <p>These practices reflect standard industry approaches to long-term data management in technology platforms.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>5. Tracking and Analytical Technologies</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Various standard tracking mechanisms are employed to monitor usage patterns and support functionality. These include cookies, beacons, local storage, and related technologies operating within and across digital environments.</p>
        <p>Such tools facilitate service optimization and contextual relevance.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>6. International Data Processing</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Data may be processed and stored in multiple jurisdictions worldwide. Users acknowledge and consent to such international transfers by using the Service.</p>
        <p>Applicable legal frameworks may vary by location.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>7. Dispute Resolution Procedures</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Any disputes arising in connection with this Policy or related practices shall be addressed through binding individual arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. Participation in collective proceedings is waived.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>8. Security and Liability Considerations</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Reasonable technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect information. However, no method provides absolute security. Liability in connection with any incidents is limited as described in applicable terms.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="notice">
        <p>Residents of certain jurisdictions may be subject to additional regional requirements or disclosures. Relevant supplemental information may be available in separate addenda or upon request. The general provisions herein apply to the maximum extent permitted.</p>
